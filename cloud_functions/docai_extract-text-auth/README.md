# Document AI Processing Function

This code represents a Google Cloud Function that is used for processing the documents. The service is listening for HTTP triggers and once it gets triggered, it initiates a Document AI (DocAI) process.

The response from the DocAI service is then saved to a designated location in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

## How It Works

1. The function reads several environment variables that contain information about the Document AI project, processor, location, and GCS output path. This information is required for the function to work correctly.

2. The function uses the `DocumentProcessorServiceClient` client from Document AI service.

3. The main function is `docai_process(request)`, which gets triggered via an HTTP request. 

4. The function takes a request body as input. The request body should be a JSON string containing the following information:
   - `bucket`: The name of the GCS bucket where the source file is located.
   - `object`: The name of the source file.
   - `contenttype`: The content type of the source file
   
5. The function first checks if the `contenttype` is of type 'image/gif', 'application/pdf', or 'image/tiff'. These are the types supported by this function.

6. If the type is supported, the function then initiates the Document AI process. 

7. The result from the Document AI process is written to a GCS bucket as specified by the `destination_uri` string. 

8. When the process is completed, the function returns a JSON response containing the `destination_uri` where the output file is found. 

## Usage

To use this function, you need to setup the following environment variables:

- `GCP_PROJECT`: Project ID for your Google Cloud Project.

- `PARSER_LOCATION`: The location of the parser in GCP.

- `PROCESSOR_ID`: The ID of the processor to be used in Document AI service.

- `GCS_OUTPUT_URI`: The URI of the destination GCS bucket where the output should be written.

- `GCS_OUTPUT_URI_PREFIX`: The prefix to be used for the output file name.

- `TIMEOUT`: The timeout for the operation.

The function can then be called via a POST request with a body in the following format:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "bucket": "</your-gcs-bucket>",
    "object": "</name-of-file>",
    "contenttype": "application/pdf"
  }
}
```

Replace `</your-gcs-bucket>` and `</name-of-file>` with the name of your GCS bucket and the name of the file you want to process respectively. The `contenttype` can be 'image/gif', 'application/pdf', or 'image/tiff'.

## Note

Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. 

Document AI is a service provided by Google Cloud that uses machine learning to understand documents. 

This function allows you to leverage these services to process documents in cloud storage with the help of Document AI. For production environments, additional error handling and retry logic might be needed.
